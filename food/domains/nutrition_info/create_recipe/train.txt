All set on my end.
Mission accomplished.

I've finished up.
Done and dusted.
That's all from me.
I've come to a close.
I'm calling it done.
I'm all wrapped up.
I've finalized it.
No more to do.
I've put the finishing touches on it.
That's my part done.
That's a wrap for me.
It's in the bag.
I've crossed the finish line.
I've checked all the boxes.
I've tied up all the loose ends.
Everything's squared away.
I've brought it to a conclusion.
It's all taken care of.
I've dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's.
I'm signing off on this.
I've accomplished my goal.
I've put this to bed.
The task is behind me.
Finished like a pro.
I've reached the finish line.
All objectives met.
It's all buttoned up.
I've sealed the deal.
I've closed the loop.
The job is done.
